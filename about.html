        <p>The government of India is considered a parliamentary democracy, which means that the executive branch of government is held accountable to the legislative branch. Under this system of government, India has both a President, who is the Head of State, and a Prime Minister, who is the Chief Executive of the executive branch.</p><br>
        <p>A government includes only those officials and persons who are appointed or elected to determine, interpret and carry out the regulations of the state. Thus it has three main organs-the legislative to determine the laws of the state, the executive to carry out these laws and the judiciary to interpret them. The sole purpose of a government is to act as the instrumentality of the state. Its powers and organization are defined by the basic law called constitution of the country.
        </p><br>
        <p>Most states have now written constitutions. The Indian Constitution is the ultimate basis for judging the legality of any law a legislative body enacts or any order an executive body issues. The Supreme Court of India has the final power to determine whether laws or executive orders are made in pursuance of the constitution.</p><br>
